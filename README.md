# 3 lane Derby track timer software.

SMM created software for Gateway To Science (Bismark, ND)

An arduino (Metro Mini) controls and watches for each track:
 - a solenoid(releases the cars),
 - a starting beam break sensor (determines active tracks and time car leaves start.)
 - a finish beam break sensor (records race finish time.) 

React app displays active tracks and finish times when race ends.
